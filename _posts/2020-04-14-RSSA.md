### General scheme of SSA 
- Th SSA-like algorithms decompose the given data ${\mathbb X}$ into a sum of different components: 
\begin{align}
{\mathbb X}={\mathbb X}_ 1 , + \dots + {\mathbb X}_ m
\end{align}

- The input data ${\mathbb X}$ can be a time series, a multivariate time series, or a digital image. 

- Thus each componets, i.e., ${\mathbb X}_ 1, \dots, {\mathbb X}_ m$), are also a time series, a multivariate time series, or a digital image which should have same dimension with ${\mathbb X}$

- The algorithm is divided into four steps.
	1. make trajectory matrix and denote it ${\bf X}={\cal T}(\mathbb{X})$. 
	2. alppy SVD (or other method) to ${\bf X}$ and express ${\bf X}$ as ${\bf X}={\bf X}_ 1+ {\bf X}_ 2+\dots +{\bf X}_ d$. In here, $d=\max\\{j:\lambda_j>0\\}$. 
	3. grouping each component, i.e., partitions $\\{1,2,\dots,d\\}$ to $m < d$ disjoint subsets $I_1,\dots,I_m$. Thus ${\bf X}$ can be expressed as ${\bf X}={\bf X}_ {I_1}+\dots+{\bf X}_ {I_m}$. The grouping with $I_j=\\{j\\}$ is called elementary. 
	4. Express ${\mathbb X}$ as ${\mathbb X}={\mathbb X}_ 1 + \dots {\mathbb X}_ m$.
