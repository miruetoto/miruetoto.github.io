- It is easy to see that **the lower $p$'s local reachability density is, and the higher the local reachability densities of $p$'s $k$-nearest neighbors are, the higher is the LOF value of $p$**. 

- **As for other objects**, including those outside of a cluster, we give a general theorem giving a lower and upper bound of the LOF. 

- Before we present theorem 1, we define the following terms. 

- Similarly, let $indirect_{max}(p)$ denote the corresponding maximum.

- Now to make our following analysis easier to understand, we simplify our discussion by requiring that ~.
