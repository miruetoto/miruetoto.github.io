### locally stationary process

- ${\bf X}=(X_1,X_2,X_3,\dots)$를 무한차원 이산시계열이라고 하자. 즉 ${\bf X}: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^{\infty}$인 함수이다. 

- ${\bf X}$가 모든 $t \in \mathbb{Z}$에 대하여 아래조건을 만족한다면 ${\bf X}$를 locally stationary process라고 부른다. 
\begin{align}
\forall t \in \mathbb{Z}, \exists {\bf Y}^{(t)} \quad s.t. \quad {\bf X} \approx {\bf Y}^{(t)}
\end{align}

- 

- The author express $X_{t,T}$ but in my posting, i would like to express it ${\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}$ since dim of $\\{ {\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}\\}$ is $d$. 

- I understand $\\{ {\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}:t=1,2,\dots,T\\}$ as ${\bf X}$ which is just $T \times d$ matrix such that (1) each columns represent the $j$-th time series with length $T$ (2) each rows represent $d$-dim random vector. 

- In this paper the author use the rescaled time-index such that
\begin{align}
\Big\\{\frac{1}{T},\frac{2}{T},\dots, \frac{T}{T}\Big\\}.
\end{align}
Note that they do not use 
\begin{align}
\big\\{1,2,\dots, T\big\\}.
\end{align}
Note that those notation have advantage the followings: (1) ${\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}$ could be easily extended the infinite arrays, i.e., the case of $T=\infty$, (2) thus it can be easily extended to continuous-like version such that 
\begin{align}
{\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}={\boldsymbol \mu}\Big(\frac{t}{T}\Big)+{\boldsymbol \epsilon}_ t.
\end{align}

- ***(Definition)*** The array $\big\\{ {\boldsymbol X}_ {t, T}\big\\}_ {T=1}^{\infty}$ is called a locally stationary process if for each rescaled time point $u\in[0,1]$, there exists a strictly stationary process $\big\\{ {\boldsymbol X}_ t(u):t\in\mathbb{Z}\big\\}$ with the property that 
\begin{align}
\\|{\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}-{\boldsymbol X}_ t(u)\\| \overset{a.s.}{\leq} \bigg( \left|\frac{t}{T}-u \right|+\frac{1}{T}\bigg){\boldsymbol U}_ {t,T}(u)
\end{align}
Here, $\\|\cdot\\|$ denotes a norm on $\mathbb{R}^d$, and $\\{U_{t,T}(u):t=1,2,\dots,T\\}_ {T=1}^{\infty}$ is an array of positive random variable whose $\rho$-th moment is uniformly bounded for some $\rho>0$; that is, $\mathbb{E}[{\boldsymbol U}_ {t,T}^{\rho}(u)]\leq C < \infty$ for some fixed constant $C$. 

- Let's understand above def. Suppose that $\\{X_{t,T}: t=1,2,\dots,100 \\}$ is $1$-dim stochastic process such that
\begin{align}
X_{t,T}=\begin{cases}
\eta_t & t=1,3,5,\dots,99 \\\\ \\
2\eta_t & t=2,4,6,\dots,100
\end{cases}
\end{align}
where $\eta_t \sim Unif(0,1)$. Let $X_t(u)=0$ and $U_{t,T}(u)=200$ for all $u,t$. Then clearly 
\begin{align}
|X_ {t,T}- X_t(u)| \overset{a.s.}{\leq} \bigg( \left|\frac{t}{T}-u \right|+\frac{1}{T}\bigg)U_ {t,T}(u)
\end{align}
since $|X_ {t,T}- X_t(u)|=|X_ {t,T}|\leq 2$ for all $u,t$ and 
\begin{align}
\min_{u,t} \left\\{\bigg( \left|\frac{t}{T}-u \right|+\frac{1}{T}\bigg)\right\\} = \frac{1}{100}. 
\end{align}
Thus above process is locally stationary process. 

- Author mentioned that the process $\\{ {\boldsymbol X}_ t(u)\\}$ can be think as approximated version of $\\{ {\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}\\}$ when given $u$. 

- Donote ${\boldsymbol \lambda}_ {t,T}$ some ***time-varying feature*** of the locally stationary process $\\{X_ {t,T}\\}$. Thus ${\boldsymbol \lambda}_ {t,T}$ could be a mean or variance of times series, i.e., 
\begin{align}
{\boldsymbol \lambda}_ {t,T} = \mathbb{E} [{\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}]
\end{align}
or 
\begin{align}
{\boldsymbol \lambda}_ {t,T}= V ({\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}).
\end{align}
 
- Generally speaking, ${\boldsymbol \lambda}_ {t,T}$ can be anything if it satisfying the following: 
> ($P_\lambda$) ${\boldsymbol \lambda}_ {t,T}$ is uniquely determinded by the set of moments 
\begin{align}
\Big\\{\mathbb{E}\big( f({\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}) \big): f \in {\cal F} \Big\\}
\end{align}
in the sense that there is a one-to-one correspondence between $\lambda_ {t, T}$ and this set, where ${\cal F}$ is a family of measurable function $f:\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$. 
 
- asdf
\begin{align}
{\boldsymbol \lambda}_ {t,T}= \mathbb{E}\big( f({\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}) \big).
\end{align}
