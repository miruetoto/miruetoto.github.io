### locally stationary process

- Suppose that sample of observations $\\{ {\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}:t=1,2,\dots,T\\}$ comes from a *locallay sationary porcess*. 

- The author express $X_{t,T}$ but in my posting, i would like to express it ${\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}$ since dim of $\\{ {\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}\\}$ is $d$. 

- I understand $\\{ {\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}:t=1,2,\dots,T\\}$ as ${\bf X}$ which is just $T \times d$ matrix such that (1) each columns represent the $j$-th time series with length $T$ (2) each rows represent $d$-dim random vector. 

- In this paper the author use the rescaled time-index such that
\begin{align}
\Big\\{\frac{1}{T},\frac{2}{T},\dots, \frac{T}{T}\Big\\}.
\end{align}
Note that they do not use 
\begin{align}
\big\\{1,2,\dots, T\big\\}.
\end{align}
Note that those notation have advantage the followings: (1) ${\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}$ could be easily extended the infinite arrays, i.e., the case of $T=\infty$, (2) thus it can be easily extended to continuous-like version such that 
\begin{align}
{\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}={\boldsymbol \mu}\Big(\frac{t}{T}\Big)+{\boldsymbol \epsilon}_ t.
\end{align}

- ***(Definition)*** The array $\big\\{ {\boldsymbol X}_ {t, T}\big\\}_ {T=1}^{\infty}$ is called a locally stationary process if for each rescaled time point $u\in[0,1]$, there exists a strictly stationary process $\big\\{ {\boldsymbol X}_ t(u):t\in\mathbb{Z}\big\\}$ with the property that 
\begin{align}
\\|{\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}-{\boldsymbol X}_ t(u)\\| \leq \bigg( s \bigg){\boldsymbol U}_{t,T}(u),\quad a.s.
\end{align}
Here, $\\|\cdot\\|$ denotes a norm on $\mathbb{R}^d$, and $\\{U_{t,T}:t=1,2,\dots,T\\}_ {T=1}^{\infty}$ is an array of positive random variable whose $\rho$-th moment is uniformly bounded for some $\rho>0$; that is, $\mathbb{E}[{\boldsymbol U}_ {t,T}^{\rho}(u)]\leq C < \infty$ for some fixed constant $C$. 

- Let's understand above def. Suppose that $\\{X_{t,T}: t=1,2,\dots,100 \\}$ is $1$-dim stochastic process such that
\begin{align}
X_{t,T}=\begin{cases}
\epsilon_i & i=1,2,\dots,50 \\\\ \\
2\epsilon_i & i=51,52,\dots,100
\end{cases}
\end{align}
