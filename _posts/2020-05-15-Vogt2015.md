### locally stationary process

- suppose that sample of observations $\\{X_{t,T}:t=1,2,\dots,T\\}$ comes from a *locallay sationary porcess*. 

- suppose that dim of $\\{X_{t,T}\\}$ is $d$. 

- we can express $\\{X_{t,T}:t=1,2,\dots,T\\}$ as ${\bf X}$ such that 
\begin{align}
{\bf X}= \begin{matrix}

\end{matrix}
\end{align}
