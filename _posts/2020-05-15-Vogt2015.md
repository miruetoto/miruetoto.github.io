### locally stationary process

- suppose that sample of observations $\\{ {\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}:t=1,2,\dots,T\\}$ comes from a *locallay sationary porcess*. 

- the author express $X_{t,T}$ but in my posting, i would like to express it ${\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}$ since dim of $\\{ {\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}\\}$ is $d$. 

- i understand $\\{ {\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}:t=1,2,\dots,T\\}$ as ${\bf X}$ which is just $T \times d$ matrix such that (1) each columns represent the $j$-th time series with length $T$ (2) each rows represent $d$-dim random vector. 

- the author also express ${\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}$ like 
\begin{align}
{\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}=\mu\big(\frac{t}{T})+\epsilon_t.
\end{align}
thus it looks like ${\bf X}_ {t,T}:={\bf X}\big(\frac{t}{T}\big)$. 

- ${\bf X}$ is called a locally stationary process if for each rescaled time point $u\in[0,1]$,
