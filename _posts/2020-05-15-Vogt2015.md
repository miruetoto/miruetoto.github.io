### locally stationary process

- Suppose that sample of observations $\\{ {\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}:t=1,2,\dots,T\\}$ comes from a *locallay sationary porcess*. 

- The author express $X_{t,T}$ but in my posting, i would like to express it ${\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}$ since dim of $\\{ {\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}\\}$ is $d$. 

- I understand $\\{ {\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}:t=1,2,\dots,T\\}$ as ${\bf X}$ which is just $T \times d$ matrix such that (1) each columns represent the $j$-th time series with length $T$ (2) each rows represent $d$-dim random vector. 

- Suppose that time-index be
\begin{align}
\Big\\{\frac{1}{T},\frac{2}{T},\dots, \frac{T}{T}\Big\\}
\end{align}
not
\begin{align}
\Big\\{1,2,\dots, T\Big\\}. 
\end{align}

- the author also express ${\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}$ like 
\begin{align}
{\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}={\boldsymbol \mu}\Big(\frac{t}{T}\Big)+{\boldsymbol \epsilon}_ t.
\end{align}
thus it looks like ${\boldsymbol X}_ {t,T}:={\boldsymbol X}\big(\frac{t}{T}\big)$, i.e., it looks like continuous times series whose (time) domain in $(0,1]$. 

- The array ${\bf X}$ is called a locally stationary process if for each rescaled time point $u\in[0,1]$,
