## About this doc

이 문서는 크게 3개의 챕터로 구성되어 있다. 

첫번째는 **Expression: Paper and Talk** 인데 이 챕터는 논문을 쓸때 혹은 해외학회에서 발표를 할때에 유용한 표현들을 모은것이다. 따라서 매우 특이한 상황과 특이한 주제에 한정된 영어표현들이다. 이 챕터에서의 대부분의 표현은 논문에서 얻었다. 혹은 드물게 구글링이나 구글번역기를 활용하여 얻은 표현도 있다. 

두번째는 **Expression: American Drama, Movie, YouTube** 인데 여기에서는 (제목에서 알수 있듯이) 영화나 미드, 유트브 등을 보며 알게된 표현을 정리하였다. 

마지막은 **The Elements of Style** 이다. 이 챕터는 **The Elements of Style** 이라는 교재의 내용을 정리한 챕터이다. 이것은 글을 쓸때 필요한 (혹은 논문을 쓸때 필요한) 규칙들을 모은것이다.

## Expression: Paper and Talk. 

### $\star$ 기타표현 

***Just as*** the French love their wine, **so** the English love their beer.
  - ***Just as*** S V, ***so do*** S'. 

For example, ***in SSA*** the eigenvectors produced by slowlyvarying series components are 
slowly-varyin. 
  - 한국말처럼 주어앞에 ***in*** 을 넣고 시작해도 된다. 

***As is well known***,

***People try to get a first impression on their data by ...***

In applications such as socail, energy, transportation, sensor, and neuronal networks, high-dimensional data naturally ***reside on*** the vertices of weighted graphs. 

***both*** CNN ***and even*** RNN

Therefore, when analyzing graph signal, measuring the differences between $v_i$ and $v_j$ ***is no less important than*** measuring the differences between $f(v_i)$ and $f(v_j)$.
  - No less important than humor is that ~. 
  - No less significant is the fact that ~ .

That is, ***those methods could be suitable for graph $({\cal V},{\cal E})$ but not suitable for graph signal $f:{\cal V} \to \mathbb{R}$***. 
  - ***It is performed optimally in the following sense***: 

Clustering ***is one of the most widely used techniques for exploratory data analysis***, with applications ranging from statistics, computer science, biology to social sciences or psychology. 
  - exploratory: 익스-플로래-토리

Clustering is one of the most widely used techniques for exploratory data analysis, ***with applications ranging from*** statistics, computer science, biology ***to*** social sciences or psychology. 

***Let me put it this way***
  - ***Something might be put like this:*** 

***The naive approach for measuring*** the distance between $f(\nu_i)$ and $f(\nu_j)$ is to use the Euclidean distance like:

This claim will seem considerably less far-fetched ***if we pause to consider something***.
  - far-fetched : 억지로 가져다 붙인 

***In constructing A's argument, A has relied on*** B. 

***There is somewhat the likelihood, however,*** that the problems associated with ~ will continue. 
  - 가능해 보이기는 하지만, 이러한 문제가 계속 발생할 수 있다.

***Now, from (4.3.4) to (4.3.7), we have the following important observations: (1) (2) ...***

### abbreviated

An autoregressive model of order p, ***abbreviated*** AR(p), is of the form 


### and so on

For example, in SSA the eigenvectors produced by slowlyvarying series components are slowly-varying, the eigenvectors produced by a sine wave are sine waves with the same frequencies, ***and so on.***
  - [S V 하고, S V 하고, 기타등등.] 의 표현은 **[S V, S V, and so on.]**와 같이 표현한다. 
  - [단어, 단어, 기타등등] 형태가 아닌 [문장, 문장, 기타등등] 형태도 가능하다는 것이 포인트. 


### as before

The setting is as follows: consider ${\cal M} \in \mathbb{R}^{N}$ to be a compact Riemannian submanifold of Euclidean space ***as before.***  
  
consider something to be A ***as before***.

### as follows: 

***The setting is as follows:*** consider ${\cal M} \in \mathbb{R}^{N}$ to be a compact Riemannian submanifold of Euclidean space as before.
  - 콜론까지 포함한 **as follows:** 자체를 그냥 명사로 보는것도 괜찮음. 

### before 

**Before** we present theorem 1, we define the following terms. 
  - **Before** we start the discussion, we will clarify some notaions.
  - **Before** S V, we will clarify some notations. 

### can be expressed as, be of the form 

An autoregressive model of order p, abbreviated AR(p), **is of the form**
\begin{align}
x_t=\phi_1 x_{t-1}+\phi_2 x_{t-2}+\dots+\phi_p x_{t-p}+\epsilon_t.
\end{align}


### case 

***As with*** the United States Supreme Court, 

***In such a case,*** a standard regression model might be used to describe the phenomenon. 

### characteristics 

***With this range of characteristics*** Pechorin presents an impressive and most unusual combination of thinker and man of artist. 

### compare

***By comparison with*** ~ , 

You can easily check this is true ***by comparing*** the spectral density of (a)-(c) represented in second row of Figure 1. 

***Compared with*** ~ , 

It provides a better interpretation ***compared to*** A in the respect that ~
  - It provides a better interpretation ***compared to*** A with respect to ~

***If you pursues a number of comparisons*** between A and B, 

### consider

***consider*** something ***to be*** A as before.

The setting is as follows: ***consider*** ${\cal M} \in \mathbb{R}^{N}$ ***to be*** a compact Riemannian submanifold of Euclidean space as before. 

### concept,notion

A very important ***notion*** in SSA is separability. 
  - 우리가 일반적으로 이야기하는 ''개념정리''의 개념은 notion으로 표현한다. concept보다는 좀 더 추상적인 느낌이다. notion은 ''본질''이라는 단어로 번역하는 것이 더 그럴듯해보인다. 

This ***concept*** generalizes to higher orders. 
  - 컨셉은 개념보다 좀 더 구체적인 무엇인가를 지칭할때 쓰는 것 같다. 내가 자주 쓰는 ''느낌''과 비슷한 표현인것 같다. 위 문장은 AR(1)모형에서 성립하는 어떠한 성질이 AR(p)에서도 쉽게 확장할수 있다는 것을 설명할때 나온 문장이다. 


### corresponding 

Similarly, let $indirect_{max}(p)$ denote the ***corresponding,*** maximum.



### denote, let  

***Denote*** $\Pi^{(H)}:{\cal M}_ {L,K} \to {\cal M}_ {L,K}^{(H)}$ ***the orthogonal projection*** on ${\cal M}_ {L,K}^{(H)}$. 
  - [Denote 수식 the 명사] 꼴로 바로 써도 된다는 점이 포인트. 즉 [Denote 수식 as the 명사] 꼴로 안 써도 된다. (생각보다 영어권에서는 as로 받아서 쓰지 않는 것 같다.)
  - ***Denote*** $\bf{\hat X}_ k={\bf X}_ {I_k}$ ***the reconstructed matrices***. 


### difference, dichotomy, constrast

**The only difference between them is** ${\cal E}$ which are represented in dotted lines.

We begin with ***the dichotomy between recurrence and transience***. 

Figure 6 shows a sharp ***constrast*** between A and B 
    
The distance induced by heavy-snow transform ***is in sharp contrast with*** that of diffusion map. 
  - The distance induced by heavy-snow transform provides a strong ***contrast*** to that of diffusion map. 
  - The distance induced by heavy-snow transform  ***contrasted greatly with*** that of diffusion map. 
  - ***The sharp contrast between A and B is*** enhenced by heavy-snow transform. 

### distinguish

The distance induced by heavy-snow transform ***can be distinguished from*** that of diffusion map.  

### [show that] 

However, a thoughtful comparision of A with B ***show that*** ~ 
  - However, a closer look at the structure ***gives a different answer*** ~ 
  - However, a close reading of the text ***reveals*** ~  

### how, why

***How to measure*** the similarity or disimilarity between $f(\nu_i)$ and $f(\nu_j)$?

***How can we define*** distance between $f(\nu_i)$ and $f(\nu_j)$?.

Let's move to Figure 1 to understand ***why it is important to consider*** the underlying structure of index set in the graph function. 


### interest

***The interesting fact is that*** those three graph (named ${\cal G}_ 1$, ${\cal G}_ 2$ and ${\cal G}_ 3$, respectively) have exactly same $f(\nu_i)$ for each $\nu_i \in {\cal V}$.

***We are interested in*** the method of measuring similarity (which is usually defined as the inverse of distance) or disimilarity (which can be consider as distance) in graph function. 

### [It seems that]

***It seems*** reasonable to assume ***that*** ~ . 

***It is not unreasonable to postulate that*** ~ . 
  - postulate: 포스튤릿, 가정하다. 

***It is highly probable that*** ~ . 

### irrespective 

***This holds true irrespective of whether*** they admit to the heuristic nature of their presuppositions ***or not***. 

### make 

${\cal E}$ ***makes*** the nodes in (a) **look similar**, and the nodes in (c) **look different**.

However, a close reading of prcess of something ***makes it clear that*** ~ 

### phenomenon 

First,  ***we note a very fundamental phenomenon*** about the ARIMA model. That is, although the model is nonstationary, the complete characteristic of process is determind for all time only by a finite number of parameters, i.e., the $\phi_i$, the $\theta_j$, and $\sigma^2$. 
  - phenomenon : 퍼나미넌 

### [point of view, perspective] 

***From another point of view***, it reveals that 

Approached from a purely ***semiotic perspective***, ~. However, a closer look at the structure gives a different answer ~ 
  - Approached from a ***perspective of manifold learning***, ~ 
  - Approached from a purely ***manifold learning perspective***, ~ 

***In the light of these consideration***, 
  - ***In the light of this***, 

***In this sense,*** 
  - ***In this reading,*** 
  - ***In this regard,*** 
  
***Viewed in this light,*** 

***Seen from this point of view,***
  - ***Seen this perspective,*** 

From all this, 

### same 

Much ***the same*** can be said of ~ . 
  - ***The same*** is true of ~ .
  - ***The same*** held true for women. 
  - ***This hold particularly true for*** ~ . 
    - 이것은 ~ 와 관련하여 특히 잘 들어맞는다. 

Lara's views and feelings ***are (virtually) indentical with*** those of Zhivago. 
  - Trediakovsky's analysis ***are (virtually) identical to*** those Sumarokov uses in his tragedies. 


### [similar, analogy]

***Similarly,*** let $indirect_{max}(p)$ denote the corresponding maximum.

It retains a great ***similarity*** between A and B. 

~ is ***similar in the respect that*** ~ 

There is a striking ***analogy*** between A and B. 
  - A and B are sturcturally ***analogous*** to each other. 

One can ***drew an analogy between*** A and B 

An interesting ***analogy*** in above case can be made to the ~ 

~ discuss different ways to define graph spectral domains, ***which are the analogs to*** the classical frequency domain, and highlight the importance of incorporating the irregular structures of graph data domains when processing signals on graphs. 
  - 이때 analgoss 는 형용사다. 따라서 문장에서 which are the analogs to 를 which are analogs to 로 바꾸는 것이 맞는 표현인것 같다. 



### such that, in the respect that 

However, those methods have limitations ***in the respect that*** they are only interested in distance between $\nu_i$ and $\nu_j$. 

### suppose 

To simplify our consumption models, ***suppose*** U.S. consumers only purchase food and all other goods where food is plotted along the horizontal axis of the indifference map.


### two regards, twofold manner

It is important ***in two regards***: (1) ~ (2) ~ . 

The image is presented ***in a twofold manner***: (1) ~ (2) ~ .

## The Elements of Style.

***Rule 1: Form the possessive singular of nouns with 's.***

_단수명사의 소유격은 아포스트로피+s 로 만든다. 끝에 s로 끝나서 's를 붙이기 어색한 경우라도 일단 "무조건" 쓴다._
- Charles's friend 
- Burns's poems

_예외적으로 아래와 같이 안쓰는 경우도 있긴한데 그냥 무시하자._
- Jesus'
- Moses' Laws
- Isis' temple 

--- 

***Rule 2: In a series of three or more terms with a single conjection, use a comma after each term except the last.***

_접속사 하나가 셋이상의 말을 연결할때, 마지막 말을 제외하고 매번 콤마를 찍는다. 즉 "단어, 단어, 그리고 단어." 와 같이 표현한다. 따라서 총 3개의 단어가 있으면 컴마는 2개를 찍게된다._
- red, white, and blue. 
- gold, silver, or copper. 

_단순히 사물을 열거할때 뿐 아니라 동작을 연결할때에도 이 규칙은 성립한다._ 
- He opened the letter, read it, and made a note of its contents. 

--- 

***Rule 3: Enclose parenthetic expresstions between commas.***

_삽입된 구나 절은 앞뒤에 콤마를 찍을때도 있다. 아래에서 unless는 접속사이므로 삽입된 것은 "접속사+S+V" 이다._
- The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot. 

_하지만 앞뒤로 컴마를 꼭 찍어야 하는것은 아니다. 즉 아래와 같이 써도 무방하다. 하지만 컴마를 찍는 이유는 가독성이 떨어지기 때문이다._
- The best way to see a country unless you are pressed for time is to travel on foot. 

_따라서 가독성을 크게 해치지 않으면 앞뒤로 콤마를 찍지않아도 괜찮다. 하지만 첫번째 콤마를 찍고 두번째 콤마를 생략하면 안된다. 따라서 아래는 잘못된 용례이다._
- Marjories husband, Colonel Nelson paid us a visit yesterday
- My brother you will be pleased to hear, is now in perfect health. 

_특히 however와 같이 한 단어의 경우는 일반적으로 컴마를 찍지 않는다._


_계속적용법의 관계대명사는 앞뒤로 콤마를 찍는다._
- The audience, which had at first been indifferent, became more and more interested.

_장소와 시간을 나타내는 관계부사 where 과 when 역시 앞뒤로 콤마를 찍는다._
- In 1769, when Napoleon was born, Corsica had but recently been acquired by France.
- Nether Stowey, where Coleridge wrote The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, is a few miles from Bridgewater.

_한정적용법의 관계대명사는 콤마를 찍지 않는다._

_i.e.와 같은 약어는 문장의 끝에 오는 경우를 제외하고 항상 앞뒤로 콤마를 찍는다._
- Finally, in the fifth part, we consider the moment problem, i.e., when is a distribution characterized by its moments.
- Remember to take some paper, a pen, etc. 

_삽입표현 앞에 접속사가 오면 첫번째 콤마는 접속사 뒤가 아니라 접속사 앞에 찍는다. (컴마사이에 있는것은 여차하면 날릴수 있는 문장인데 수틀리면 접속사 포함해서 날려야 할테니)_
- He saw us coming, and unaware that we had learned of his treachery, greeted us with a smile.
  - treachery: 배반
  
--- 

***Rule 4: Place a comma before and or but introducing an independent clause.***

_등위절을 연결하는 등위접속사 and 와 but 앞에는 콤마를 찍는다._
