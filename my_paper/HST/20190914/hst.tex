\noindent 
This paper presents a new multiscale transforms, termed 'heavy-snow transform', which is motivated by observing snow accumulation. Heavy-snow transform provides multiscale visualization which can capture the shape of land (or data structure) with different resolution. Some measures based on heavy-snow transform are newly defined to describe dissimilarity between data and the importance of data. Furthermore, some statistical applications are studied.

\section{Introduction}
In this study we will propose a new method which can measure the distance between nodes in \emph{graph function}. In here, graph function $f$ is real valued function such that $f:{\cal V} \to \mathbb{R}$ where ${\cal V}$ is set of nodes (or vertices). We are interested in the distance or similarity(which is usually defined as the inverse of distance) in graph function. 

Let $\nu_i$ and $\nu_j$ be a specific nodes in ${\cal V}$ and $f(\nu_1)$ and $f(\nu_2)$ be a value at $\nu_i$ and $\nu_j$. How to measure the similarity or disimilarity between $f(\nu_i)$ and $f(\nu_j)$? In other words, how can we define distance between $f(\nu_i)$ and $f(\nu_j)$?. The naive approach for measuring the distance between $f(\nu_i)$ and $f(\nu_j)$ is to use the Euclidean distance like: 
$
\|f(\nu_i)-f(\nu_j)\|_2:=\sqrt{(f(\nu_i)-f(\nu_j))^2}.
$ Of course, someone can use other measures such as Gaussian kernel weighting function. Those measures do not have a problem when they measure the distance of points which resides Euclidean space. However, it is reasonable to think that the graph function resides in not only Euclidean space but also graph space. (Note that $f(\nu)\in \mathbb{R}$ but $\nu \in {\cal V}$.) The problem is here. Distance between $f(\nu_i)$ and $f(\nu_j)$ depends on disimilarity in Euclidean domains but distance between $\nu_i$ and $\nu_j$ depends on disimilarity in graph domains, which is determined by \emph{links} (or \emph{edges}), i.e., ${\cal E}$. However the methods presented above have limitations in that they do not consider the ${\cal E}$ when measuring the distance between observations. In here, considering \emph{links} between observation means that consider the structure of indices, i.e., ${\cal E}$. Let's move to Figure 1 to understand why you should consider the structure of index set in the graph function. 

Figure 1 is made from example introduced in Shuman (2012). There are three graph function in Figure 1. The interesting fact is that those three graph have exactly same $f(\nu_i)$ for each $\nu_i \in {\cal V}$. The only difference between them is ${\cal E}$ which are represented in dotted lines. Due to ${\cal E}$ all connected nodes in (a) seems to have a similar values but (c) is not. In other words, (a) looks like a low-frequency signal, while (c) looks like a high-frequency signal. (b) feels halfway between (a) and (c). You can easily check this is true by comparing the spectral density of (a)-(c) represented in second row of Figure 1. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Fig/Fig1.png} 
\caption{Example 1 in Shuman (2012)}
\end{figure}

The underlying structure of graph function ${\cal E}$ affects distance between $\nu_i$ and $\nu_j$, and it affects the similarity (or disimilarity) between $f(\nu_i)$ and $f(\nu_j)$ as discussed in Figure 1. Therefore, when analyzing graph function, measuring the distance between $\nu_i$ and $\nu_j$ is no less important than measuring the distance between $f(\nu_i)$ and $f(\nu_j)$. In other words, the distance in the graph domain is just as important as the distance in the Euclidean domain.

Various methods have been developed to measure the differences between nodes. The most common method is the shortest path, which measures the shortest distance between two nodes. Klein and Randić (1993) suggest the resistance distance which can measure the distance between nodes in undirected graph. Lafon and Lee (2006) suggest the diffusion distance. However, those methods have limitations such that they are only interested in distance between $\nu_i$ and $\nu_j$. That is, those methods could be suitable for graph $({\cal V},{\cal E})$ but not suitable for graph funtion $f:{\cal V} \to \mathbb{R}$. 

Thus, our goal is that: Develope new distance considering the distance in vertex domain and the distance in the Euclidean domain simultaneously. To do this, we propose a new distance that takes into account the distance between the vertex domain and the distance from the Euclidean domain at the same time through an elegant technique called \emph{heavysnow transform}. We will formally define heavysnow transform in Section 2, instead, in this section, we will just breifly introduce the main idea and motivation of heavy transform. After that we will explain why our proposed distance is a reasonable measure which can properly mix the information of the graph and Euclidean domains. 

The heavysnow transform is invented by observing snow accumulation over the land or ground. In this study, you can consider the ground as graph function $f$ and snow as some positive constant $b$ we will stack on $f$. Let $\tau$ be the number of falling snow. Our propose distance, named \emph{snow distance}, is defined 
\[
sdist(\nu_i,\nu_j; \tau):=\mathbb{E}\| h(\nu_i; \tau )- h(\nu_j;\tau)\|_2.
\]
In here, $h(\nu_i;\tau)$ will be defined more strictly at Section 2. In this section, you can consider $h(\nu_i;\tau)$ as the updated value of $f(\nu_i)$ after $\tau$. In other words you consider $h(\nu_i;\tau)$ as snowy ground. If we set $\tau=2$, then $h(\nu_i;\tau)$ will be one of $f(\nu_i)$, $f(\nu_i)+b$ and $f(\nu_i)+2b$. 

As you can see, when $\tau = 0$, the snowdist between two nodes $\nu_i$ and $\nu_j$ becomes $\|f(\nu_i)-f(\nu_j)\|_2$, which is exactly same as Euclidean distance. However, as $\tau$ increases, the snow distance starts to mix the distance in the Euclidean domain and the distance in the graph domain. That is, as $\tau$ increases, the structure of ${\cal E}$ is additionally reflected in dissimilarity between $f(\nu_i)$ and $f(\nu_j)$. This is the key to considering both graph and Euclidean domains simultaneously. 

How is this possible? This is due to the very unique feature of snow accumulation. For your easy and intuitive understanding, let's see Figure 2. In Figure 2-(a), (b), and (c), the curved lines which are located in the bottom of each figure represents ground or graph function $f$. If you put a less viscous material like rain on $f$, it would look like (a). If we add a highly viscous material to $f$, it would look like (c). If material has medium viscosity like snow, it would look like (b). In other words, to have a shape like (b), the snow stacked on $v_i$ with following characteristics: 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Snow can flow to adjacent areas.
\item Snow cannot flow to higher ground. 
\end{enumerate}
Note that (i) needs the information of ${\cal E}$, i.e., it needs information of graph domain since (i) is determinded by whether or not $v_i$ and $v_j$ are connected.  On the other hand, (ii) relates to the values of $f(v_i)$ and $f (v_j)$ which is information of Euclidean domain. Therefore, the process of snow accumulation can be reproduced only with the information of both domains. As a result, the distance between snowy ground $h(\nu_i,\tau)$ and $h(\nu_j,\tau)$ is surprisingly mixed with information from both domains. (This is covered more closely in Section 2.)

If the viscosity is too high, the shape of the snow accumulations will always like (c), regardless of the structure of the index set ${\cal E}$. This is the result of considering only the values defined in the Euclidean domain and ignoring the graph domain information. Conversely, (a) tends to ignore information in the Euclidean domain too much. In (b), the information from the Euclidean domain and the vertex domain are well balanced.

\end{figure}

The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines heavy-snow transformation and proposes some statistics based on heavysnow transformation. 
Section 3 introduces some visualization techniques that can effectively show the results of heavysnow transform. Section 4 presents possible applications of heavysnow with various numerical experiments and real data analysis. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 5 where a possible use for smoothing is briefly discussed as a future research topic. 

\section{Heavy-Snow Transform}
\subsection{Definition of Heavy-Snow Transform}
Before defining heavy-snow transform, we would like to explain data structure to which the transformation is applicable. 
Let ${\cal V}$ be set of nodes (or vertices) and ${\cal E}$ be set of links (or edges). In the context of heavy-snow transformation, the link means a way that snow can move in. Basically, you can consider ${\cal V}=\{\nu_1,\dots,\nu_n\}$ as given index set such as ${\cal V}=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. However, it is often reasonable to view node as realization of some random variable $X$. This can be illustrated by setting node as $v=X(\nu)$. 

Let $X:{\cal V} \to \mathbb{R}^M$ be a random vector and $V=\{v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n\}$ where $v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n$ is $i.i.d.$ realization of $X$. Note that $\forall v \in V : ~ X^{-1}(v) \in \sigma(X)$ where $\sigma(X)$ is smallest $\sigma$-field which makes $X$ as random variable. Thus $X^{-1}(v_i)$ is always well defined. Let $\boldsymbol E$ be the $n \times n$ matrix whose $(i,j)$-th element is defined by 
$$E_{ij}=\begin{cases} 1 & (\nu_i,\nu_j)\in {\cal E} \\ 0 & (\nu_i,\nu_j) \notin {\cal E}.\end{cases}$$ Furthermore, let's define another $n\times n$ matrix $\boldsymbol W$, where each element $w_{ij}=w(v_i,v_j)=w(\nu_i,\nu_j)$ represents the similarity between two node $\nu_i$ and $\nu_j$ (or $v_i$ and $v_j$). Define $(V,{\boldsymbol E},{\boldsymbol W})$ triple as weighted graph ${\cal G}$. The \emph{graph function} $f$ is real valued function such that 
\[
f : V \to \mathbb{R}.
\]
Thanks to the well defined $X$, for all $f$ there exists $f^{\ast}: {\cal V} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f^{\ast}:f\circ X^{-1}$.
Furthermore, we define a set of linked vertices with a particular vertex $v_i$ as ${\cal N}_{v_i}=\{v_j: (\nu_i,\nu_j) \in {\cal E} \}=\{v_j:E_{ij}=1\}$.

From now on, we explain how to implement the phenomenon of snow accumulation. Let's come back to Figure 2 for easy understanding. Figure 2 (a), (b) and (c) show different viscous materials stacked on the same ground. For the case of Figure 2 (a), material flows to local minimum, which might be similar to the accumulation of rainwater. On the other hand, the material in Figure 2 (c) does not flow and just stacks up above ground. The most important property of the material in (a) is `continue to flow until blocked'. Note that small viscous materials do not accumulate. Those small viscous materials such as water accumulate only when they reach the local minimum. On the other hand, the most important property of highly viscous materials such as (c) is `stacking.' They only accumulate and never flow. 

The snow can be interpreted as having a medium viscosity between two materials of Figure 2 (a) and (c), as metioned in Section 1. In order to express the viscosity of the snow, we assume that snow has both feature of (a) and (c). In other words, snow continues to accumulate AND flow until blocked. 
For your easy understanding let's assume some specific situation as follows: 

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item (snow falls) Draw $u$ from $V$ with probability $\frac{1}{n}$. Suppose that snow falls at $u$ as much as $b$. 
\item (accumulation) Like (c) snow stacks on $u$. Thus, in this case, value on $u$, i.e., $f(u)$ will be updated by $f(u)+b$. 
\item (flows or blocked) After accumulation, snow can move to one of ${\cal N}_{u}$ which is neighborhood of $u$. Of course, if ${\cal N}_{u}=\emptyset$, the snow will no longer flow. Then snow can always flow from $u$ to $v \in {\cal N}_{u}$ in the case of ${\cal N}_{u}\neq \emptyset$? The answer is NO since snow cannot flow high. In otherwords, ${\cal N}_{u}\neq \emptyset$ does not necessarily mean that snow can flow. Thus, we should compare value of $f(u)+b$ and $f(v)$ to check flowbility of snow, i.e., we should check ${\cal U}:={\cal N}_{u} \cap \{v: f(v) \leq f(u)+b\}$ is emptyset or not.
\begin{itemize}
\item (flow) In the case of ${\cal U}\neq\emptyset$, which is an unblocked situation, snow (which stays in $v$) can flow to $u$ that is randomly sampled element from ${\cal U}$ with probability $\frac{w(u,v)}{\sum_{v \in {\cal U}}w(u,v) }$. 
\item (blocked) If ${\cal U}=\emptyset$, which is a blocked situation, snow can't flow anymore. In this cases, the next node is randomly selected from $V$ with probability $\frac{1}{n}$. 
\end{itemize}
\item (next iteration) In the cases of `flows', go back to step 1 and repeat above procedure with assuming that snow falls at $v$ (which is element of ${\cal U}$) as much as $\gamma b$. In here $\gamma \in (0,1)$ is parameter adjusting viscosity of snow. (If you choose very small $\gamma$, shape of snow accumulation will be (c) in Figure 2.) For `blocked' situation, go back to step 1 with assuming that snow falls at $v^*$ (which is randomly selected node in $V$ with probability $\frac{1}{n}$) as much as $b$.
  
\end{enumerate}

The following is the formal definition of heavy-snow transform.
\begin{dfn}\label{snow:df_hst}
Let ${\cal G}=(V,{\boldsymbol E},{\boldsymbol W})$ be the weighted graph with $|V|=n$ and $f$ be the graph function defined on ${\cal G}$. Let $b$ be the amount of falling snow and $\tau$ be the number of falling snows. Define $\{\tilde v^0,\tilde v^1,\dots ,\tilde v^{\tau}\}$ as \emph{traces of snow} which is determinded by the transition probabilities 
\[
p^{\ell}(u,v)=
\mbox{Prob}(\tilde v^{\ell}=v|\tilde v^{\ell-1}=u)
=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{n}  & {\cal U}^{\ell-1}= \emptyset \\ 
\frac{w(u,v)}{\sum_{v\in {\cal U}^{\ell-1}} w(u,v)} & {\cal U}^{\ell-1}\neq \emptyset 
\mbox{ and } v \in {\cal U}^{\ell-1}\\ 
0 & {\cal U}^{\ell-1}\neq \emptyset \mbox{ and } v \notin {\cal U}^{\ell-1}
\end{cases}
\]
where ${\cal U}^0=V$ and 
\[
{\cal U}^{\ell}=\big\{v: h^{\ell}(v)\leq h^{\ell}(\tilde v^{\ell})+\xi^{\ell}(\tilde v^{\ell}), v\in {\cal N}_{\tilde v^{\ell}}\big\}
\]
is a set of vertices where snow can flow in step $\ell$. In here, $h^{\ell}(v)$ is the $\ell$-th \emph{snowyground} and $\xi^{\ell}(v)$ is the $\ell$-th \emph{snow} such that 
\[
h^{\ell}(v)=h^{\ell-1}(v)+\xi^{\ell}(v)
\]
where $h^{0}=f$ and 
\[
\xi^{\ell}(v)=	\begin{cases}
0 & v \neq  \tilde v^{\ell} \\
\gamma \xi^{\ell}(\tilde v^{\ell-1})  & v =  \tilde v^{\ell} \mbox{ and } {\cal U}^{\ell-1}\neq \emptyset \\
b &  v = \tilde v^{\ell} \mbox{ and } {\cal U}^{\ell-1} = \emptyset
\end{cases}
\]
with fixed $\gamma\in(0,1)$. 
Define ${\cal H}(f,{\cal G};\tau):=\big\{h^{\ell}(v)\big\}_{v \in V,~\ell \leq\tau }$ as \emph{heavy-snow transform} of $f$. 
\end{dfn}
The Heavy-snow transform is very similiar with random walk in graph function. The traces of snow can be considered as walks. The difference is transition probability $p^{\ell}(u,v)$ depends on 
\begin{thm}
The heavy-snow transform is \emph{ergodic}, i.e., there exists unique stationary distribution $\pi^{\star}(v)$ such that 
\[
\pi^{0}(v)\prod_{\tau=1}^{\infty}{\boldsymbol P}^{\tau}=\pi^{\star}(v)
\]
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}
The heavy-snow transform is \emph{reversible}, i.e., it verifies the following:
\[
\pi^{\star}(u)p^{\star}(u,v)=\pi^{\star}(v)p^{\star}(v,u).
\]
\end{thm}


\subsection{Snowdistance and some properties} 
\begin{dfn}
Let ${\cal G}=(V,{\boldsymbol E},{\boldsymbol W})$ be the weighted graph with $|V|=n$ and $f$ be the graph function defined on ${\cal G}$. Let ${\cal H}(f,{\cal G};\tau)$ be heavy-snow transform for $f$. Define the \emph{snow distance matrix} as ${\widetilde{\boldsymbol W}}^{\tau}$ its $(i,j)$-th element is 
\[
\tilde w^{\tau}_{ij}=\tilde \rho^{\tau}(v_i , v_j) := \frac{\|{\boldsymbol h}_i- {\boldsymbol h}_j\|_2 }{\sqrt{d_id_j}}
\]
where ${\boldsymbol h}_i=(h^{0}(v_i),\dots,h^{\tau}(v_i))'$ and $d_i=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\|{\boldsymbol h}_i- {\boldsymbol h}_j\|_2$. 
\end{dfn}

\begin{thm} 
Let $\rho^{\star}(\nu_i,\nu_j)=\tilde \rho^{\infty}(X(\nu_i),X(\nu_j)).$ 
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
We want to show that 
\[
\rho^{\star}(\nu_i,\nu_j)\leq \rho^{\star}(\nu_i,\nu_k)+\rho^{\star}(\nu_k,\nu_j).
\]
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
Let ${\cal H}({\boldsymbol f};\tau)$ be the heavy-snow transform of ${\boldsymbol f}$ and $b_{\tau}$ be the amount of falling snow. Assume followings:
\begin{itemize}
	\item ${\boldsymbol f}$ is continuous on $V$. 
	\item $b_{\tau} \to 0$ and $\tau b_\tau \to \infty$ as $\tau \to 0$.
\end{itemize}
Then there is homotopy function between $\rho^{(0)}$ and $\rho^{(\infty)}$. 
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Define $H:V \times [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $H(v,\ell/\tau):=h^{(\ell)}(v)$ and $H^*:V \times [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $H^*(v,\cdot):=\lim_{\tau \to \infty} H(v,\cdot)$. $H^*$ is continuous function. 
\end{proof}
\subsubsection{Regular graph}
\begin{rmk}
Suppose $f(v_1),\dots,f(v_n)$ is $i.i.d$ random sample and $(V,E,W)$ be the regular graph. Let ${\cal H}(\boldsymbol{f};\tau)$ be a heavysnow transform of ${\boldsymbol f}$. Since $f(v_i)$ is $i.i.d.$ random variable ${\boldsymbol h}_i$ can be thought as $i.i.d.$ random vector (\textcolor{red}{need to prove, using `regular graph'}) such that 
\[
{\boldsymbol h}_1,\dots,{\boldsymbol h}_n \sim F.
\] 
Define functional $T(F)$
\[
T(F):=\int g({\boldsymbol h}) dF.
\]
Let $F_n$ empirical distribution function of ${\boldsymbol h}_1,\dots,{\boldsymbol h}_n$, i.e., 
\[
F_n({\boldsymbol h}\leq t ) :=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}1({\boldsymbol h}_i\leq t).
\]
From Glivenko-Cantelli lemma we have $F_n \to F$. Thus for sufficiently large $n$, we can say that $F_n$ is neighborhood of $F$. Thus 
\begin{align*}
T(F_n) & \approx  T(F)+\int IF(\boldsymbol{h},T,F)d(F_n-F) \\
& = T(F)+\int IF(\boldsymbol{h},T,F) dF_n
\end{align*}
where $IF({\boldsymbol h}; T,F,\tau)= \lim_{t\downarrow 0}\frac{T\big((1-t)F(\boldsymbol{h}) + t \delta(\boldsymbol{h}) \big)-T(F(\boldsymbol{h}))}{t}$ is influence function of $T$. In here $\int IF(\boldsymbol{h},T,F)dF=0$ is used. Thus 
\[
\sqrt{n}\Big(T(F_n)-T(F) \Big) \to N(0,V(T,F))
\]
where $V(T,F)=\int IF(\boldsymbol{h},T,F)^2 dF$.
\end{rmk}

\begin{rmk}
Let $d_{ij}=\|{\boldsymbol h}_i-{\boldsymbol h}_j\|_2$. Using above remark, we get $d_{ij} \sim N(T(F),V(T,F)/n)$ where $T(F):=\int d_{ij}dF$. Note that $T(F) \to 0 $ as $\tau \to \infty$. Further, we can conclude that $V(T,F)/n \to 0$ as $\tau \to \infty$. Thus ${\bf D} \to {\bf 0}$. 
\end{rmk}

\begin{rmk}
Define sensitivity curve as 
\[
SC_{n}({\boldsymbol h};\tau)= \frac{T\big((1-1/n)F_{n-1}(\boldsymbol{h}) + 1/n ~ \delta(\boldsymbol{h}) \big)-T(F_{n-1}(\boldsymbol{h}))}{1/n}.
\]
This is sample version of $IF({\boldsymbol h},T,F)$.

\subsubsection{Seoul Metro data}
\noindent\textbf{\underline{Data dercription}}

In this example, we analyze subway passenger data of Seoul Metro Line 2 on March 7, 2014, which is represented in Figure \ref{snow:subway_in_0}. In this figure, $x$-axis denotes station, $y$-axis represents time, and color shows the number of people to get on Line 2. As one can see, each cell looks highly associated with vertical ones and horizontal ones; thus the data are spatially and temporally linked data. Another interesting point is that Line 2 is a circular line, so the next station of City Hall is Chungjeongno. Therefore, the data are arranged (linked) in a cylindrical shape.

%\begin{sidewaysfigure}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.05\textwidth]{Fig/In_data.pdf}
	\vspace{-13mm}
	\caption{Subway passenger data of Seoul Metro Line 2 in March 7, 2014.}
	\label{snow:subway_in_0}
\end{figure}	
%\end{sidewaysfigure}

So the exact data structure looks like Figure \ref{snow:datasrt}. Each point connected with temporally, and spatially. So this is a spatio-temporal data. If we fixed time then this is the circular data, and if we fixed the station then this data is time series. 

\begin{figure}

\vspace{-13mm}
\caption{Data structure of subway passenger data with Seoul metro line 2 in March 7, 2014.} 
\label{snow:datasrt}
\end{figure}

\noindent\textbf{\underline{Oneday analysis}}

Figures \ref{snow:subway_in_01} to \ref{snow:subway_in_5} show the importance plot of subway passenger data with ${\cal T}=10,100,200,300,400,500$. In local scale analysis, the most important cell is Gangnam station at 6 pm. It looks like a very reasonable result because Gangnam station is considered the hottest place in Seoul at that time. In addition to Gangnam station, some stations or group of stations are also considered to be important. In the morning of rush hour time, the residence area such as Sindorim, Guro Digital Complex, Sillim, Seoul National University and Jamsil stations are considered to be important. In the evening of rush hour time, the office area such as Guro Digital Complex, Gangnam, Yeoksam, Seolleung, Samsung and Euljiro 1-ga are considered to be important as well. 

When growing scale up to ${\cal T}=300$, the importance of Euljiro 1-ga station surpass the Gangnam station, and in the case of  growing scale more, the importance of Sillim station surpasses the Gangnam and Euljiro 1-ga stations. Why the importance of each cell changes over scale ? Look at the Figure \ref{snow:subway_in_0} again. We easily check that vertical array from Gangnam station at 18:00 to Gangnam station at 24:00 have high values, and we also check that horizontal array from Gangnam station at 18:00 to Samsung station at 18:00 have high values, too. Thus, we expect that the value of Gangnam station at 18:00 will be high since it is cross point of those two arrays. But, the situation is something different in Sillim station at 7:00--9:00. The values of these two cells cannot be expected by any linked data because these are extremely high than other linked cells. In summary, the value of Gangnam station at 18:00 can be expected by linked data, but those of Sillim station at 7:00--9:00 cannot be expected by linked data. So if we examine data with global scale, that means if we more widely consider the linked data, then the value of Gangnam station at 18:00 is more predictable than Sillim stations at 7:00-9:00. Thus the value of Gangnam station is less important than Sillim station.

\section{Concluding Remarks}
Heavy-snow transform is a new multiscale visualization technique which is motivated by observing how snowfall accumulates. The concept of heavy-snow transform is shared with that of scale-space theory in computer vision. Heavy-snow transform is useful for evaluating some probabilistic structures of linked data whether a particular set of observations is similar to nearby other or not. We define the dissimilarity of the data and define the importance of the data based on it. We also introduced useful applications such as change-point detection and smoothing.

\iffalse %%% some useful comments in concluding remarks. 
Another interesting key point is that the heavysnow transform have a \emph{multiscale} attribute. In (b), the case of least snow falling ($\tau=20$) relatively identifies the detailed features of underlying function, while the case of most snow falling ($\tau=160$) captures the global trends of it. In other words, the snowy grounds constructed by different $\tau$'s hold multiscale concept that can be interpreted as ``zoom-in" and ``zoom-out" of the signal. As one can see, the amount of snow accumulation is closely related to the resolution of data visibility, so $\tau$ can be considered as a multiscale parameter in scale-space analysis.

This multiscale attribute of heavysnow transform allows us to accept various points of view that define the dissimilarity between data. To better understand, consider the example in Figure 3. This example will be analyzed later in section xx, so we will omit details here. Groups A, B, and C, shown in the upper left of Figure 3, were generated from normal distributions with mean $0$, $1$, and $5$, respectively. Our question is:  
 Which group looks the least similar to the others? Although the question is simple, there may be several answers to this question. For example, the following answers are possible:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\it First point of view (average distance between clusters):} The C group is the most different from other groups. Because A's mean is 0 and B's mean is 1, so there is no big difference between them, but the mean of C is 5, which is much larger than the mean of A and B.
\item \textbf{\it Second point of view (rarity, outlier):} Group B is the most unusual group. Because observations belonging to group B are rarer than other groups. (The number of observations in group A and C is 400 and 50, respectively, but the number of observations in group B is XX)
\item \textbf{\it Third point of view (change point):} The points at the border of group A and group C are most unusual. This is because  sudden mean change occurs at this point.
\end{itemize}
Each point makes sense. The first perspective is suitable for clustering data according to specific criteria. The second point of veiw consider the scarcity of the data. Thus, it can be applied to outlier detection. (If there is only one point belonging to group B, this one point can be seen as outlier.) The third perspective can be used to detect change point. 

Figure 3 (b)-(d) show the dissimilarity of the given data. The proposed method can produce various viewpoints by controlling the multiscale parameter $\tau$,  and viewpoints depicted in Figure (b) to (d) are the results of our proposed visulization techneque described in section XX. As you can see, since heavysnow transform has the property of multiscale, it is possible to express various views of dissimilarity by only adjusting $\tau$.

이상검출은 비유사성의 개념과 밀접한 관련이 있다. Breunig(2000)은 두 자료간의 비유사성을 측정하고 이를 활용하여 자료의 이상성을 측정하는 새로운 기준인 local outlier factor를 제시하였다. 그 외에도 비유사성과 이상성을 함께 연구한 수많은 연구가 있다. 하지만 이러한 이상검출기법은 미리 정해진 규칙(자료의 무리로부터 떨어진 점을 이상점으로 간주)에 따라 이상값을 찾아내는 비지도학습형태의 기법이므로 미리 정해진 규칙이 이용자의 의도와 맞지 않는 경우 적절하게 이상값을 검출해 낼 수 없다. 본 연구에서 다루는 방법은 인덱스집합의 구조를 고려하는 정도에 따라 이상점을 판단하는 규칙을 변경할 수 있다는 장점이 있어 이용자의 의도와 맞는 이상점을 검출해낼 가능성이 높다. 또한 일반적인 산점자료에서 수행되는 이상검출과 달리 자료의 인덱스의 구조를 함께 고려하는 특징으로 인하여 변화점탐지를 마치 이상점탐지와 같은 기법으로 수행할 수 있다는 장점이 있다.  
* 그림2의 관점3에서 탐지되는 변화점은 기존의 이상점탐지와 동일한 기법으로 수행된 것임.

\noindent\textbf{(2) 차원축소와 클러스터링}

차원축소란 고차원의 자료가 가지는 본질적인 정보를 가능한 유지하면서 저차원의 자료로 변환하는 기법이다. 하지만 일반적인 차원축소는 원래자료가 가지고 있던 유사도를 손실하는 경우가 있어 자료간의 유사성을 보존하면서 차원축소를 하려는 연구가 활발히 진행되었다. He, X (2004)는 입력표본간의 유사도를 이용한 새로운 차원 축소기법을 제안하였으며 Belkin (2003)는 유사도행렬을 활용한 새로운 차원축소기법을 제안하여 swiss-roll 형태의 매니폴드를 가지는 자료를 2차원 공간으로 효과적으로 맵핑하는 기법을 소개하였다. Ng. A.Y. (2002)는 자료간 유사도를 유지하는 차원축소를 수행하고 통상적인 K-평균 클러스터링을 수행하는 알고리즘을 소개하였다. 이러한 기법들의 핵심은 유사도행렬을 활용하여 차원축소기법에서 자료의 매니폴드를 효과적으로 유지하다는 것에 있다. 하지만 기존의 유사도행렬은 인덱스집합의 구조에 따라 달라지는 비유사성을 포착하기 불가능하다는 단점이 있으며 이는 자료의 매니폴드를 구체화하는 표현력을 억제한다. 반면 제안된 방법을 활용하면 다양한 매니폴드에서 정의된 자료에 대한 거리를 이용자의 의도에 맞게 재정의할 수 있어 다른 공간으로 맵핑시킬 때 이를 효과적으로 표현가능하다는 장점이 있다.

\noindent\textbf{(3) 멀티스케일 디콤포지션} 

From the above example, we describe a brief idea of the proposed transformation and present its preliminary definition that represents data over various scales by $\tau$ and performs some useful data analysis. The main advantages of the proposed transformation is two-fold: (a)  A particular multiscale approach (transformation) is typically designed for a specific group (class) of data such as one-dimensional data (sequence, line) or two-dimensional data (two-array object, plane). In some sense, the scope of data structure that can be handled by a multiscale method is limited. On the other hand, the proposed transformation extends the scope to `linked data' that cover a wide class of data, which will be defined later. Roughly speaking, the heavy-snow transform can be applicable to any data structure that snow can be accumulated. (b) We present new two measures based on the proposed transformation, termed dissimilarity and importance, which utilize the inherent characteristics of the transformation; hence, these are useful for identifying and analyzing various data, and  further are applicable to some application such as smoothing or detection problem.   

In literature, there exist numerous multiscale methods that may share a multiscale concept of the proposed method. SiZer by Chaudhuri and Marron (1999) is a visualization technique that displays smoothed data as a function of location and bandwidth over a range of bandwidths, which is motivated by the `scale-space' theory in computer vision (Lindeberg, 1994). Several attempts for variants of SiZer have been developed (Hanning and Lee, 2006; Hanning et al., 2013; Park et al., 2009, Park et al., 2010). Moreover, many scale-space methods have been studied. For an extensive review of statistical scale-space methods, see Holmstr\"oma (2010) and Holmstr\"oma and Pasanena (2017). As another scale-space method, Fryzlewicz and Oh (2011) proposed thick-pen transformation which plots time series data over a range of thickness values of pen. As other direction of multiscale methods, wavelet transformation has been extensively studied for representation of inhomogeneous one- or two-dimensional data. For details of wavelets in statistics, see  Vidakovic (1999) and Nason (2010). 

The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Section 4.2 defines heavy-snow transformation and proposes some statistics based on heavy-snow transformation, dissimilarity and importance of data for statistical data analysis. In Section 4.3, numerical experiments including real data analysis are presented. As for a challengeable aspect, Seoul Metro passenger data that are a kind of cylinder data structure are used. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 4.4 where a possible use for smoothing is briefly discussed as a future research topic.

\iffalse %%% definition of importance 
\subsection{Statistical Measure of Heavy-Snow Transform}

A bottom curve in Figure \ref{snow:motivatingex} represents $X_i$ and other curves represent the snowy ground, $Y_{i,\tau}$ with various $\tau$. The interesting thing is that if $X_i$ and $X_j$ have a different local structure, then $\{Y_{i,\tau}\}_{\tau=0}^{\cal T}$ and $\{Y_{j,\tau}\}_{\tau=0}^{\cal T}$ also have a different sequence. Therefore, we can express a dissimilarity of $X_i$ and $X_j$ as distance between $\{Y_{i,\tau}\}_{\tau=0}^{\cal T}$ and $\{Y_{j,\tau}\}_{\tau=0}^{\cal T}$.

\begin{dfn}
	Let $\{X_i\}$ be the given data and ${\cal N}_{i}$ be a set of linked values with $X_i$. Let  $\{Y_{i,\tau}\}_{\tau=0}^{\cal T}$ be the heavy-snow transform on $(\{X_i\},\{{\cal N}_i\})$. A dissimilarity between $X_i$ and $X_j$ is defined as
	\[
	d_{\cal T}(X_i,X_j)=E\left[\rho\left(\{Y_{i,\tau}\}_{\tau=0}^{\cal T},\{Y_{j,\tau}\}_{\tau=0}^{\cal T}\right)\right], 
	\]
	where $\rho\left(\{Y_{i,\tau}\}_{\tau=0}^{\cal T},\{Y_{j,\tau}\}_{\tau=0}^{\cal T}\right)=\|(Y_{i,0},\dots,Y_{i,{\cal T}})-(Y_{j,0},\dots,Y_{j,{\cal T}}) \|_2^2.$
\end{dfn}

Based on the definition of dissimilarity, we define an importance of each observation.

\begin{dfn}
	Let $\{X_i\}$ be the given data and ${\cal N}_{i}$ be a set of linked values with $X_i$. Let $d_{\cal T}(X_i,X_j)$ be the dissimilarity between $X_i$ and $X_j$. For fixed $\delta>0$, an importance of specific observation $X_{k}$ is defined as 
	\[
	imp(X_{k},{\cal T})=\frac{\left|\{X_{j}:d_{\cal T}(X_{k},X_{j})>\delta\}\right|}{\left|\{X_i\}\right|}, 
	\]
	where $|A|$ is the cardinality of set $A$. 
\end{dfn}

Note that if $X_i=c(\in \mathbb{R})$ for all $i$, then $d_{\cal T}(X_i,X_j)=0$ for all $i,j$, which implies that all data points have the same importance. If $\delta \to \infty$, then $imp(X_i,{\cal T}) \to 0$ for all $i$; thus, the entire data points are not important. If $\delta \to 0$, then $imp(X_i,{\cal T}) \to 1$ for all $i$, so it means that all of data points are important. Hence, it is necessary to choose an  appropriate $\delta$ to measure the importance of the data.

\subsection{Simulated Examples}
In this section, we present some examples of heavy-snow transforms with one-dimensional data. For all examples, we set  ${\cal N}_i=\{X_{i-1},X_i,X_{i+1}\}$, $b=0.02\times \sqrt{V(\{X_i\})}$ and $p_{ij}=\frac{1}{3}$.

Figure \ref{snow:ex1_1} shows a realization of $X_i$, where observations with $\mu=1$ are marked as green and observations with $\mu=5$ are marked as blue.

	\label{snow:ex1_2}
\end{sidewaysfigure}


The first row in Figure \ref{snow:ex1_2} is the result of the heavy-snow transform with ${\cal T}=10,~200$ and $600$, where the x-axis represents the index of the data, the y-axis represents $\tau$, and the color represents the value of $Y_{i,\tau}$. As one can see, $\{Y_{i,\tau}\}_{i=1}^{1000}$ with small $\tau$ represents $\{X_i\}$ with high-resolution and $\{Y_{i,\tau}\}_{i=1}^{1000}$ with large $\tau$ represents $\{X_i\}$ with low-resolution. Thus, this map is clearly a multiscale representation. 

The second row in Figure \ref{snow:ex1_2} shows principal component plot of $\{Y_{i,\tau}\}_{\tau=0}^{\cal T}$ with different $\cal T$. Note that blue and red/green ones are well separated in x-axis. Thus, it can be interpreted that the first principal component is thought of as an overall average of data. The interpretation of the second principal component could be more difficult than first one. It is related to the structure of linked data, that is, the land-shape. To understand the meaning of second principal component, suppose that snow falls as much as $\tau=1$. Then value of $E(Y_{i,1}-X_i)$ is perfectly determined by considering structure between $X_{i-1},X_{i}$ and $X_{i+1}$. So, the values of $E(Y_{i,1}-X_i)$ are divided by the following types of land-shapes:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item local minimum: $X_i=\min(X_{i-1},X_i,X_{i+1})$
	\item local maximum: $X_i=\max(X_{i-1},X_i,X_{i+1})$
	\item flat: $X_{i-1}=X_i=X_{i+1}$ 
	\item uphill: $X_{i-1}<X_i<X_{i+1}$
	\item downhill: $X_{i-1}>X_i>X_{i+1}$
	\item flat-uphill: $X_{i-1}=X_i<X_{i+1}$ or $X_{i-1}>X_i=X_{i+1}$
	\item flat-downhill: $X_{i-1}=X_i>X_{i+1}$ or $X_{i-1}<X_i=X_{i+1}$
\end{enumerate}
Note that for all $i$, $P(X_{i-1}=X_i)=0$ in this example. Thus, we could not consider (iii), (vi) and (vii). Note also that values of $E(Y_{i,1}-X_i)$ are the same in the cases (iv) and (v). Thus, the values of $E(Y_{i,1}-X_i)$, amount of snow accumulation, can be roughly divided into three groups according to the land-shapes and these are represented in three straight lines in the left panel of the second row. 

The second row in Figure \ref{snow:ex1_2} also contains a multiscale concept. In ${\cal T}=10$, data can be roughly divided into two groups, blue one and red/green ones. And each group can also be divided into three groups according to land-shape. If one increases the scale up to ${\cal T}=200$, in other words, if you more widely consider the linked data, then groups of blue, green, and red dots are clearly distinguished, compared to ${\cal T}=10$. Instead, three straight lines disappear, so we no longer know whether each observation is local maximum or minimum. In other words, we lose some local-scale information. Now, let's move the principal component plot with ${\cal T}=600$, which shows the most global-scale analysis. We easily check that there are some points at which the value of the second principal component is very high. These points are located in the neighborhood of $i=700$ or $i=800$, which are the points where sudden mean changes occur. Note that detecting these points need more wide consideration about linked data. So these points are not separated from the main group in the local-scale analysis. 

For a fixed $\delta$, an importance of specific point $X_{k}$ can be calculated by counting how many points are in $\{X_j:,d_{\cal T}(X_{k},X_{j})>\delta\}$. In this example, we choose $\delta$ as the median of $\{d_{\cal T}(X_{i},X_{j}): i,j \in \{1,\dots,1000\} \}$. Results for calculation importance of data are shown in the third row. Importance is marked by various colors and sizes. Bigger ones are more important than small ones and purple ones are more important than red ones. The interesting thing is that importance of data changes over scales. In the local-scale analysis, observations which are located in $i \in (700,800)$ are considered to be important. However, in the global-scale analysis, observations where sudden mean change occurs (such as $i=700$ or $i=800$) are considered to be more important.

Figure \ref{snow:ex2_1}(a) shows a realization of $X_i$, where red, green, blue, light blue and purple colors represent $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^{472}$,  $\{X_i\}_{i=473}^{502}$, $\{X_i\}_{i=503}^{522}$, $\{X_i\}_{i=523}^{552}$ and $\{X_i\}_{i=553}^{1024}$, respectively. As one  can see, the data have a single change point in $i=513$ and blue ones contain this sudden mean changes. Green and light blue ones are the neighborhood of the change point. Figure \ref{snow:ex2_1}(b) shows principle component plot of $\{Y_{i,\tau}\}_{\tau=0}^{\cal T}$, where ${\cal T}=120$. The red ones and purple ones are separated from each other. Thus, data with $\mu_i=0$ and $\mu_i=5$ are well separated in ${\cal T}=120$. We would like to emphasize that the green, blue and light blue ones are also separated from their main groups because they are located around the change point. So which points are important in Figure \ref{snow:ex2_1}(b)? One can easily check that red and purple area are denser than the areas where green, light blue and purple are located. So the importance of $\{X_i\}$ will be high in the neighborhood of the change point. Figure \ref{snow:ex2_1}(c) shows $(i,imp(X_i,120)) $, the importance plot. Here, we choose $\delta$ as the median of $\{d_{{\cal T}=120}(X_{i},X_{j}): i,j \in \{1,\dots,1000\} \}$ as in Example 4.1. As expected, $imp(X_i,120)$ has a peak in $i=512$, where the sudden mean change occurs. Figure \ref{snow:ex2_1}(d) shows another importance plot as in the third row of Figure \ref{snow:ex2_1}.

Furthermore, the importance of $X_i$ can be applicable to a smoothing problem that estimate $\mu_i$ from $X_i$. The following is the proposed smoothing procedure. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1. ] Calculate the importance of $X_i$, i.e., get the $imp(X_i,{\cal T})$. 
	\item[2. ] For $b=1,\dots,B$, get $X_i^{(b)}$ such that 
	\[
	X_i^{(b)}=\begin{cases} X_i, & i \in M \\ 
	\tilde{X}_i, & i \in M^c,
	\end{cases}
	\]
	where $M$ is length-$N_0(<N)$ samples without replacement from a population of $\{1,2,\dots,N\}$ with weight $$\mathbf{w}=\left(imp(X_i,{\cal T}),\dots,imp(X_N,{\cal T})\right)$$ and $\tilde{X}_i$ is linearly interpolated value from $\{X_i\}_{i\in M}$. 
	\item[3. ] Get $\hat{\mu}_i=\frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^{B}X_i^{(b)}$ 
\end{itemize}
The key of the above procedure is that we do not use random sampling. Instead, we consider the importance of data as sampling weight. Thus, the important data is more likely to be sampled than other. 

Figure \ref{snow:ex2_2} shows the smoothing results. Left-top panel shows the original data. The red line in the left-bottom denotes a  wavelet fit by EbayesThresh (Johnstone and Silverman 2005). The green line in right-bottom represents a wavelet fit by SURE threshold (Donoho and Johnstone 1994). The result by our proposed method is shown as the yellow line in the right-top panel. In this example, we choose $\cal T$ as $120$ and $N_0=50$. As one can see, the performance of the proposed method is comparable to  the wavelet fits and we want to emphasize that our method is not limited to the data structure.
